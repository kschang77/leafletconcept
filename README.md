# leafletconcept

This is a leaflet.js concept there, that uses OpenStreetMaps tiles. 

There's a click event handler. If you click anywhere on the map, it'll tell you where you clicked vs. where the map center is. 

Next iteration will probably have a cross-hair, and checks for zoom level, along with a button to check whether we are close enough to the target.
